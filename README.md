# OceanWP WordPress Theme Sample Data
This is the sample data files for the <a href="https://oceanwp.org/" title="OceanWP WordPress Theme" target="_blank">OceanWP WordPress Theme</a> and has been made accessible for buyers.

You must extract the zip after downloading and select only the file you wish to import.

## Important
The demos were created with Elementor and the <a href="https://oceanwp.org/extensions/" title="OceanWP Extensions" target="_blank">extensions</a> of the theme, so if the plugins/extensions are not enabled on your site before the import, you will not have all pages as presented in our demos.

There will be no errors on your site if you do, so, if you have other plugins that replace those used in demos (as Beaver Builder instead of Elementor) and you want to import a specific page, you can do it.
